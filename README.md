Description:

This visualizer provides an interactive demonstration of the N-Queens problem, a classic puzzle in computer science. The goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in a way that no two queens attack each other. This visualizer allows you to explore different board sizes, observe the solving process step-by-step, and visualize multiple solutions if they exist.

How to Use:

Open the HTML file: Ensure you have an HTML editor and a web browser installed. Open the index.html file in your preferred HTML editor.
Run the code: To view the visualizer, open the index.html file in a web browser.
Interact with the controls:
Board Size: Adjust the board size by entering a number in the input field (minimum 4).
Speed: Select the desired speed for the animation (Slow, Normal, Fast).
Solve with Animation: Click this button to watch the solver find a solution step by step.
Solve Instantly: Click this button to find all solutions without animation.
Reset: Click this button to clear the board and start over.
